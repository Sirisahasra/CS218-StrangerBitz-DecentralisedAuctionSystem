# BlockBid – Decentralized Auction System

**Project Number:** _Project 5_

BlockBid is a blockchain-based decentralized auction platform built on Ethereum. It allows users to create auctions, place bids through MetaMask wallets, securely withdraw refundable bids, and finalize auctions automatically using smart contracts without relying on any centralized third party.

- Secure bidding using MetaMask wallets  
- Automatic highest bidder tracking  
- Refund support for outbid users  
- Auction finalization after deadline  
- Decentralized image and metadata storage using IPFS  
- Reentrancy attack protection  
- Gas-optimized smart contract design  

---

## **Tech Stack**

## **Smart Contract Overview**

Main Contract: `Auction.sol`

### **Core Functions**

#### `createAuction()`
Creates a new auction with IPFS CID, starting price, and duration.

#### `placeBid()`
Allows users to place valid higher bids.

#### `withdrawBid()`
Allows outbid users to securely withdraw refundable balances.

#### `endAuction()`
Ends auction after deadline and credits seller balance.

#### `getAuction()`
Returns complete auction details.

#### `getPendingReturn()`
Returns refundable balance for a specific user.

---

## **On-chain vs Off-chain Design**

### **Stored On-chain**

- Seller wallet address  
- Highest bidder address  
- Highest bid amount  
- Auction deadline
- Auction Status
- Auction ended status  
- IPFS CID  

### **Stored Off-chain (IPFS)**

- Product image  
- Product description  
- Metadata JSON  

### **Reason**

Blockchain storage is expensive and permanent. Large files are stored on IPFS, and only the CID is stored on-chain.

---

## **Security Measures**

- OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard`
- `nonReentrant` modifier
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Seller cannot self-bid
- Double withdrawal prevention
- Double auction ending prevention

---

## **Gas Optimisation**

We optimized storage variables to reduce gas costs.

### **Before**

Used default `uint256` for all numeric variables.


### **After**

```solidity
uint96 highestBid;
uint96 startingPrice;
uint64 deadline;
```

### **Example Gas Report**

| Function | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| createAuction() | 142102 | 116609 |
| placeBid() | 76472 | 58107 |

### **Why It Improved**

Smaller datatypes allow efficient storage slot packing, reducing gas consumption.

---
## **Testing**

Comprehensive Hardhat automated test suite implemented for contract functionality, validation checks, edge cases, and security scenarios.

### **Total Test Cases:** 21

### Test Cases Covered

1. Should create auction  
2. Should return auction ID  
3. Should reject empty IPFS hash  
4. Should reject zero starting price  
5. Should reject zero duration  

#### Bidding Logic
6. Should accept valid bid  
7. Should reject seller bidding on own auction  
8. Should reject bids lower than current highest  
9. Should reject equal bids  
10. Should reject bids for invalid auction  
11. Should reject first bid below starting price  
12. Should move previous highest bid to pendingReturns  

#### Withdrawals
13. Should allow withdrawal of pending returns  
14. Should reject withdrawal when no funds available  
15. Should not allow double withdrawal  

#### Auction Ending
16. Should end auction after deadline  
17. Should revert endAuction before deadline  
18. Should not allow ending auction twice  
19. Seller receives highest bid after auction ends  
20. Should reject bids after auction ends  

#### Multiple Auctions
21. Should support multiple auctions simultaneously  

#### Security
22. Should prevent reentrancy attack
